Markup: #Introduction#
In this project, we leverage the power of RoBERTa to predict sentiment labels for movie reviews. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. The RoBERTa model has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text and can be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis.
